### Hi there, Francesco here 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working as a Tech Lead at @utilitywarehouse
- 🌱 I love to contribute to open-source, especially [gopls](https://github.com/golang/tools/commits/master?author=rentziass) (and a little [go](https://github.com/golang/go/commits/master?author=rentziass) 🙂)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I used to play basketball for a living and I'm a huge keyboard nerd ⌨️
